 	 	<h1> Lab 13: Debug</h1>
 	
 	 <h2>Challlenge</h2>

<p> As the name suggests, we are learning how to debug our javascript. Since our code is starting to become more complez, we have to be ready to fix it. so we have to find an old lab that didn't work properly and try to get that lab under control   </p>
	 <h2>Problems</h2>
<p> For this debugging lab, I ended up going back to lab 10. That previous lab only worked half way, it was supposed to print out users input and shuffle the letters. However it only spat back the unalterted input, so i had to go back and remedy this issue. After plugging in my debugger tool, I came to a conclusion. My code was held together with sticks and glue, and needed to be revised. So I took it apart and tried to simplfy the javascript to something managable. </p>
   
	<h2>Results</h2>
 <p> the results are found in this screenshot. I fixed my issue with lab 10, apparently i just needed to condense my script. </p>
