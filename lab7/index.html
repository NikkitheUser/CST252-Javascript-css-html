 	 <h2>Challlenge</h2>

<p> The issue that we have to tackle is making functions in javascript. We have to make a function that will ask you to enter in your name, and then it will arange the letters in your name in alphabetical order.  </p>
	 <h2>Problems</h2>
<p> Small mistakes kept popping up, mainly it had to do with incorrect brackets and misplaced spacing in some strings. It did take around 10 minutes of fiddling around in javascript to get the output to appear on the html webpage.</p>
   
	<h2>Results</h2>
 <p> The results of our work can be seen below in the Script Output example. </p>
