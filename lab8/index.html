 	 	<h1> Lab 8: Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>
 	 </head>
 	 <h2>Challlenge</h2>

<p> For a fun challange, we have to make a timed function, and an anon function. In order to achive this, we had to make three sets of tests. One test is the usual script function, another function that is not named and a third that spits out its function in different times.   </p>
	 <h2>Problems</h2>
<p> The problems that occured for this lab came from forgetting how to set up a couple of these functions. I wanted to try to see if I could remeber how to do these tasks without looking at notes, w3schools or the examples on ilearn. It took longer to do and i did give up and look at examples but, it gave me a way to practice by myself.  </p>
   
	<h2>Results</h2>
