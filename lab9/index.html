 	 	<h1> Lab 9: JavaScript for the Web</h1>
 	
 	 <h2>Challlenge</h2>

<p>For this lab assignment, we have to add things to the html and change things to the css through our Javascript. Two elements have to be added into our html, and two elements have to be modified as well.   </p>
	 <h2>Problems</h2>
<p> A lot of problems occured on my side. I thought that the biggest issue came from the "appendChild" portion. No matter what I did, the console would spit back "cannot read property 'appendChild' of null." However after comparing my script with Faye nothing seems off. I even placed all of my code into JSfiddle, and it works flawlessly. So I wasn't sure why it didn't work at all. By the end, a classmate reminded me that i forgot to add "defer" into my script src up top. which fixed everything</p>
   
	<h2>Results</h2>
 <p> The results can be seen down below in the script output! The results are a red "hello?" and a green "I can't hear you!" </p>
