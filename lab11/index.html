 	 	<h1> Lab 11:Conditionals</h1>
 	
 	 <h2>Challlenge</h2>

<p>  For this lab we had to learn how javascript conditionals work. Lab 11 deals with the concept of “if” and “else” statements in Javascript. To demonstrate this, We have to make a function that would spit out a hogwarts house based on the number of letters inputed to the function. </p>
	 <h2>Problems</h2>
<p> While the if and else statements are easy to grasp, there was an issue that halted progress. "button.addEventListener"  kept turning up 'null.' It took a while to get it to properly interact with the function.</p>
   
	<h2>Results</h2>
 <p> With everything done, why not take this function for a spin? Go on, type in your name and get something in return. </p>

 	<h3> Script Output</h3>
 	
 	<div id= oops>

 	<button id="doit"> submit </button>
