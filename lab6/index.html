 	 	<h1> Lab 6: Arrays and Objects</h1>
 	 </head>
 	 <h2>Challlenge</h2>

<p> For this paticular lab, we had to set elements into Arrays. We basically had to use Javascript to create an organized list of objects. In this case, we had to make an array for our main mode of transportation. </p>
	 <h2>Problems</h2>
<p> The array was easy enough to put together, what was difficult on my end was setting up the proper "writeln" and "JSON." It took multiple tries to get it working on the final index. The issue stemmed from not placing commas and brackets in their proper locations. </p>
