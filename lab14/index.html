 	 	<h1> Lab 14: Javascript Classes and Objects</h1>
 	
 	 <h2>Challlenge</h2>

<p> For this lab, we have to create an object output. To do this, we used the make model stc. of our past vehicles to test out this lab out.  </p>
	 <h2>Problems</h2>
<p> The only real issue that we ran into was formatting the script. a lot of syntax errors plauged my console. A slight problem with getting the output to appear on the html, but i just had to change the "console.log" to "return" </p>
   
	<h2>Results</h2>
 <p>on the script output, you can see the two vehicles i have owned. one of them was in a horrible car wreck the other is still working fine.  </p>
