 	 	<h1> Lab 19:AJAX </h1>
 		

 	 <h2>Challlenge</h2>

<p >After learning how AJAX works, we now have to add a working API to our work. We must add working api to a button, that will do something as simple as give out trivia or stats. </p>

	 <h2>Problems</h2>

<p > Finding an API that explained itself was difficult. Most api we were looking at were behind paywalls or subscriptions. Other apis just didnt document itself well enough or were to vauge to be usable. Sadly, I tried a joke api but depsite everything, from debugging to the console, the jokes only appeared on the console. So I ended up just using the covid-19 api </p>


	<h2>Results</h2>

 <p> press that button down there and see what happens!</p>
