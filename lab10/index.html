 	 	<h1> Lab 10: JavaScript Events and Forms</h1>
 	
 	 <h2>Challlenge</h2>

<p> Using Events and Forms we have to create a function that displays whatever the user enters into the input forum.  </p>
	 <h2>Problems</h2>
<p> We have to use our professors script on his lab 7 page. However, an error would occur for the write.ln portion and nothing seemed to work. But after figuring out that we didn't have to use that paticular code and that we can use our own, things started to look simplier. </p>
   
	<h2>Results</h2>
 <p> in the script output, you can write anything you want and it will be displayed on the webpage! </p>

 	<h3> Script Output</h3>
<div id= oops>



<input type="text" id="my-input" value="Imput Your Name" onfocus="this.value=''">
<button id="my-button">Submit Input</button>
	<div id= "output"></div>
</div>
	<div link>
		<h2> Debug</h2>
		<p> This assignment has been debugged, thanks to lab 13. My previous submission wouldn't rearrage the input it recived. Now after i went through the debugging lab, i fixed the issue. Now I am not entierly sure what went wrong, since my understaning of javascript is very limited. But i came to the conlusion that my function was to complicated, since the console kept picking up different errors, from syntax to something about left-hand assignment. So I ended up condenseing my script that would be easy to read and for the console to output.</p>
