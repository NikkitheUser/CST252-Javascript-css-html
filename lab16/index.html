 	 	<h1> Lab 16:Libraries & Intro to jQuery </h1>
 	
 	 <h2>Challlenge</h2>

<p> Lab 16 is the intro to Jquery and its library of coding assests. For this assignment, we have to make a button thats colored green that when clicked an alert will pop up on screen. To do this, we have to do all of it with jquery and try to make the button in the JS as well.  </p>
	 <h2>Problems</h2>
<p>A major issue is making the button. Since we just started using jquery, I'm not familiar with the proper layout of writing out the scripts. I managed to get the button to be green and create an alert. But, making the button in the JS and not in the JS is lost on me.  </p>
   
	<h2>Results</h2>
 <p> Press that green boy down there and see what happens! </p>

 	<h3> Script Output</h3>
 	 	<div id= "oops">
<input id = "btnSubmit" type="submit" value="Release"/>
      This is a button 
  </button>
