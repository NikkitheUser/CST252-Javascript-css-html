 	 	<h1> Lab 12: Loops</h1>
 	
 	 <h2>Challlenge</h2>

<p> We have been introduced to loops. Looping allows us to do multiple commands with only a few strings. For this lab, we have to create a loop and be able to have it print out on our webpage.  </p>
	 <h2>Problems</h2>
<p> TYhe only real problem I hit was getting my loops to appear on the page. Getting it to work on the console was no problem what so ever. It only took me a while for things to work since i forgot how to use outputStr. </p>
   
	<h2>Results</h2>
 <p> The results of my labor can be seen under the script output. Press the button and be amazed at my dumb humor. </p>
