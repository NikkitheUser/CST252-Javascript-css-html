 	 </head>
  <h2>Challlenge</h2>

<p>In this lab, we had to learn how to understand the differences in data types and how it effects the javascript code. </p>
  <h2>Problems</h2>
<p> Most problems that did occur stem from being briefly confused to how "var" works. After getting through that small issue, everything worked out smoothly.   </p>
  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p> The results of our work can be seen below in the Script Output example. </p>
