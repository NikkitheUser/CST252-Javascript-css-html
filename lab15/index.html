 	 	<h1> Lab 15: Object-Oriented Design</h1>
 	
 	 <h2>Challlenge</h2>

<p> For Lab 15, we have to edit our lab 14 script. In order to do this, we had to change the protype code to reflect the new class structure. The results should be the same, but created slightly differently.  </p>
	 <h2>Problems</h2>
<p> Only problem I ran into was trying to figure out how to add all the other componets of the car into the class structure. I almsot made a series of child scripts, while I only had to make on child script to attach to the parent script.  </p>
   
	<h2>Results</h2>
 <p> In the script output you can see the results! The make, Model, color, year and status of my car can be seen! </p>
