 	 	<h1> Lab 4: Pseudocoding and Problem-solving</h1>
 	 </head>
  <h3>Challlenge</h3>

<p>In this lab, we had to understand how to pseudo code in preperation for JavaScript programing. This will require us to breakdown an everyday task into organized steps and to add comments for a game of rock paper scissors as if we were planning to code it in the future. </p>
  <h3>Problems</h3>
<p> The main problem we faced was condensing everday tasks into a very robotic and organized list. This also goes for the pseudo coding of the Rock,Paper, Scissors game, since we had to pretend we were planning on coding a game with JavaScript. </p>
  <h3>Results</h3>
 <h4>Everyday Task</h4>
<p>Charging an electric bike:
<ul>1. Bring bike into dorm</ul>
<ul>2. Pull out charging cord</ul>
<ul>3. Place bike next to an outlet</ul>
<ul>4. Open charging input port cover</ul>
<ul>5. Plug charger input into input port </ul>
<ul>6. Plug lightning into the outlet</ul>
<ul>7. Wait 4 to 6 hours for the bike to fully charge</ul>
<ul>8. Pull out the cord when fully charged</ul>
<ul>9. Ride off into the sunset</ul>
</p>





<h4>Pseudocode a computer task</h4>
<p>Rock, Paper, Scissors:</p>
<ul>1. Layout out the 3 options</ul>
<ul>2. Accept user input</ul>
<ul>3. Randomize computer input</ul>
<ul>4. Evaluate results</ul>
<ul>5. Test for win condition</ul>
